# Quantum Machine Learning Library for Quantum log-likelihood minimization (QMLQLLM)

A quantum machine learning framework for minimizing the quantum log-likelihood. I am considering a 
catchier name for this framework in line with PennyLane and Strawberry Fields (Rocky Raccoon? Glass 
Onion?).

This project is far from finished, but the most important code is there: The `QLModel` and `QMLWrapper` classes are the core of this project and seem to work fine for now.

# Whitepaper

The research behind this project can be found in the [whitepaper](https://github.com/therooler/pennylane-qllh/blob/master/docs/pennylane_qllh.pdf)

# Documentation

The code documentation can be found [here]( https://therooler.github.io/pennylane-qllh/). The Docs are generated automatically
with [pdoc3](https://pypi.org/project/pdoc3/). Code is formatted according to PEP8 standards using 
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

# Constructing your own model

Explain `QLModel` and `QMLWrapper`.
