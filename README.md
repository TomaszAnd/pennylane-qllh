# Quantum Machine Learning Library for Quantum log-likelihood minimization (QMLQLLM)

A quantum machine learning framework for minimizing the quantum log-likelihood. I am considering a 
catchier name for this framework in line with PennyLane and Strawberry Fields (Rocky Raccoon? Glass 
Onion?)

# Constructing your own model

The `QMLModel` class in `resources.model.core` provides a template for writing you own hybrid model.
